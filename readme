With using this you can easily find the minimum cost of spanning tree 
The code in written in cplus 
Added the  time  library for checking the time that how much time it will take to run the functions that is the prims 
So You have to enter the amount of nodes and edges 
Then put the node number from where to the destination it is written as x and y as destination point and simply enter the weight
The loop will run until the number of nodes and edges that you have entereed in the node and edges and taken before as input from yours
If you don't understand the code just simply ask anything 
Have a nice day keep learning
